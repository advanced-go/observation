A controller policy needs the following:
 1. Some way to create a complete URL given an incoming request
    a. If the request contains a authority, then it should b automatic

 2. Timeout - optional as this defaults to 3 seconds

 3. RateLimiting - only disabling is allowed as rate limiting is enabled by default with the
                   rate limit and rate burst configured dynamically. The threshold to start
                   rate limiting is also determined dynamically based on experience
 4. Policy - controls how a host is selected
    a. Need the ability to limit possible hosts
       - Limit by Region, Zone, SubZone, Host


B. When authority URL's are used.
   1. Ingress controllers
      a. Need a list of ingress authorities to publish.
         - One timeout override for ingress host controller
         - Need the authority/module version
   2. Egress controllers
      a. Need a list of egress authorities
         - Route Name
         - Optional timeout
         - Optional disabling RateLimiting - rate limiting is good for transient latencies
         - Need the authority/module version
         - Include egress origins by Region, Zone, SubZone, Host
         - Exclude egress origins.
         - Need an optional timespan so that the origins can be tested during off hours.
           Can this be configured dynamically??


C. How to remove an authority? - USE VERSIONING
   1. Suddenly disappears, egress controller needs to react.
   2. Permanently, need to be guidance set by a user

D. How to handle versioning??
   1. Can we use existing module versioning? YES
      - This would have to be in the meta-data of what you have and what you need.
      - Need to allow for a version mask, so that you can support semantic versioning
   2. Append a version number to the authority.
      - How would this scheme correlate to an exact module version?
