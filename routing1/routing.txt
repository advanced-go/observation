// Host and primary configuration are as follows:
	// Primary - route to host unless upstream failure rate exceeds a threshold, then route to secondaries
	//           based on filters. If not filters are configured then stay on primary. Once the rate falls
	//           below the threshold, fail back to the host
	// Default - route to host on startup, then rely on secondaries for all routing. Without secondary
	//           filters, then remain on host.
	//

When a new host starts up then the host should send the configuration.
  1. Trigger a host startup message so that the existing Egress controller can update the
     routing information.
